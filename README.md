<h2>About</h2>
Q-Week 2021 Project for 1st Year Digital Arts & Entertainment: Game Development in Howest University of Applied Sciences

<h2>Description</h2>

This project contains a console and graphical exercise. The console exercise is to print out the alphabet after asking
the user how many letters will be maximally printed out per line. The graphical exercise is to draw randomly colored circles
after releasing the left mouse button with the mouse cursor as the center of the circles. The circles will grow until they reach 
a randomly generated maximum radius in a given interval, after which they will shrink until they disappear. The circles immediately
stop growing and start shrinking after they collide with the boundaries of the screen, and become red. The growing and 
shrinking speeds are adjustable with the up and down arrow keys.
